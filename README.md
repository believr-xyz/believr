<p align="center">
A decentralized social platform where early backers co-invest in creators they believe in and share in their rise. Powered by Lens Protocol, it enables creators to launch tokenized campaigns to raise support, while backers earn rewards, access, and a stake in their journey.
</p>

## Features

- **Creator Campaigns** – Launch tokenized posts to raise funds directly from your community.
- **Fan Co-Investment** – Fans can collect and co-invest to gain ownership and rewards from their favorite creators.
- **Revenue Sharing** – Supporters earn a stake in a creator’s future success.
- **Exclusive Access** – Unlock gated content and private communities from creators.
- **Community-Owned** – Transparent, on-chain relationships with no intermediaries.

## How it Works

### For Creators

- Raise early funds directly from your true believers
- Build a loyal, invested community — not just followers
- Share success with the people who backed you from day one

### For Believers:

- Support creators you believe in — and share in their rise
- Get exclusive access, rewards, and real ownership
- Be more than a follower — be part of the story
